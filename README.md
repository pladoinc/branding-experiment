# Branding Experiment

This was an experiment to improve the branding provided by the slogan on the home page.

## Versions

We tried two versions of this, one that is dynamically positioned and one that is
statically positioned. Both looked nicer but the Board elected to use the static positioning
in production.

Static: [Demo](https://pladoinc.github.io/branding-experiment/static.html)

## Final Product

As the website is hosted on Squarespace, the code had to be ported over to something that
could be stuck inside of a code block on the home page.
