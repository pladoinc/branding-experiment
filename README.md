# Branding Experiment

This was an experiment to improve the branding provided by the slogan on the home page.

## Versions

We tried a few different experiments to make this work. All are written in ES6 and assume
that you are running a modern browser.

 - Original: [Demo](https://pladoinc.github.io/branding-experiment/index.html)
 - Static: [Demo](https://pladoinc.github.io/branding-experiment/static.html)
 - Typed: [Demo](https://pladoinc.github.io/branding-experiment/typed.html)

## Final Product

As the website is hosted on Squarespace, the code had to be ported over to something that
could be stuck inside of a code block on the home page.

Prerequisites are checked using modernizer (I think that's what Squarespace is using? or
at least some fork of it.) For mobile devices, the animation is not run and instead a random
phrase is chosen.

This script can be found in [public/typed.js](public/typed.js).
